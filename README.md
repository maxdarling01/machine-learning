Lab 2
In this lab, I tasked my machine to see if it could figure out if a student would have an equal to or greater than GPA of 3.2. Having it use models such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and a Decision Tree, I would be able to analyze which model performs best, and if the winning model is accurate enough to recommend for future use.

The first chunk of code is imported the necessary packages to perform this analysis. The second chunk of code reads the data, and returns statistics and information about the data. The third chunk of code sets up the models and evaluates them. Run each chunk as needed.
